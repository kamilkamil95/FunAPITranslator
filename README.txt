Features
- For ease of use, I decided to use one of the entityframework databases I already have. ( configuration is already implemented).
- Data storage is divided into database and NLogger (where we can find data related to the functioning of the application and user actions).
- To make the application extensible to new languages, I decided to create a scraper that takes data from the website.

- For a quick view of the functionality of the application, I am including a diagram.


A few words from me
Not quite sure if there is a time frame, the free time I spent over the weekend doing this project didn't turn out to be enough for unit tests, so they are in a very basic form. If time allows I will be happy to work on them in a private repository on github.
